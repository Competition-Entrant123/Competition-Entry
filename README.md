Competition Entry
All code is in the programming language Mathematica. 
Both image processing code and artificial intelligence code is included. 
TestPics.nb includes all image processing code, from applying the Shen Castan edge detection algorithm to simply binarizing the images of the cancer cells. Most, if not all code in this file is test code, and is not used in the final results. 
CellDensityAi.nb details how the convolutional neural net was designed in the project. We began testing the artificial intelligence potential on these cancer images through running artificial intelligence using a Random Forest model, which eventually ended up in the convolutional neural net used in the paper. 
Drawer.nb details how we used Mathematica to create some of the figures used in the final paper.
SiemensGraphs.nb details how we used Mathematica to visualize the results that were outputted from the convolutional neural net.
